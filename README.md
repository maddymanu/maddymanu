### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently building the future of Microservices @Cortex (YC W20)

Over the last few years, here are a few things Iâ€™ve worked on:  
-> Built Web apps in Javascript, TypeScript, React.  
-> Built Scalable Backend systems in TypeScript, Node, GoLang, GraphQL   
-> Provisioned & Orchestrated Infrastructure using AWS & Terraform.  
-> Built CI/CD Pipelines using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Python.  
-> Built Data Infrastructure from scratch using AWS QuickSight, Looker, PostgreSQL, SQL Views, Redshift etc.  
-> â€¦ much more!!!  


Outside of work, I enjoy working out, and reading/writing about tech. Hereâ€™s a post I wrote on GraphQL vs REST, back when I was just getting started with GraphQL: https://medium.com/@aditya.bansal93/initial-impressions-of-graphql-from-a-rest-guys-perspective-71a89e81444b
